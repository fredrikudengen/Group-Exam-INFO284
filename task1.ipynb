    "b) Models: Build four (4) machine learning models for predicting the assigned review score based on the review’s content. Sentiment analysis is recommended. One of the models needs to be a neural network (e.g. LSTM). You are welcome to train models that are not covered in the course. Evaluate the performance of the built models using the appropriate evaluation metrics."
