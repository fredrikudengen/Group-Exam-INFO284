    "a) Train a convolutional neural network as a binary classifier determining whether a given image was created by a person or generated by AI. In order to create such a classifier, it is recommended to start by finetuning a preexisting CNN. You must explain why the given model is the best choice for the task. You are also welcome to build a new architecture from scratch; however, you will need to identify and overcome the challenges posed by this decision in order to receive a good grade. If you have to chose a suboptimal model due to resource limitations, note what the optimal choice would have been and why yours is the best given your limitations. Usage of free online resources such as Google Collab is highly recommended.\n",
    "b) Find 5 new images (or create those yourself), show how you would use your model to classify the new images, and test the performance of your model on those images."
